# Create a contact group

When you create an alert rule, you can specify a contact group as the receiver of alert notifications. If the alert rule is triggered, Application Real-Time Monitoring Service \(ARMS\) sends alert notifications to the contacts in this contact group. This topic describes how to create a contact group.
