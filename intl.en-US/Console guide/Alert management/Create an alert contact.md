# Create an alert contact

If an alert rule of Tracing Analysis is triggered, notifications are sent to the specified contact group. Before you create a contact group, you must create a contact. When you create a contact, you can specify a mobile phone number and email address for the contact to receive notifications. You can also specify the webhook URL of a DingTalk chatbot to automatically receive alert notifications.
