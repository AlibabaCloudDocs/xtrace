# RAM user authorization

Before a RAM user can call a Tracing Analysis API operation, you must attach the required permission policies by using your Alibaba Cloud account.

## Permissions

The following table lists the system permissions policies supported by Tracing Analysis.

|Policy|Type|Description|
|------|----|-----------|
|AliyunTracingAnalysisFullAccess|System policy|Read/write|
|AliyunTracingAnalysisReadOnlyAccess|System policy|Read-only|

After either of these permission polices is attached to a RAM user, the RAM user can call Tracing Analysis API operations.
