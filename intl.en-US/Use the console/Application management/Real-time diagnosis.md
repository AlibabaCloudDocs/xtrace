# Real-time diagnosis

After the data is reported to the Tracing Analysis component, the Tracing Analysis component performs real-time aggregate computing on the data. Generally, there is a certain delay. If you want to see the real-time result when locating a problem, you can use the real-time diagnosis function to quickly display the diagnostic result.

-   Real-time diagnostics enables temporary storage. After data is reported, you can quickly display diagnostic results without real-time statistics.
-   Real-time diagnosis does not affect normal statistics, and is automatically disabled in five minutes. After the function is disabled, you can enable it again.
-   By default, the real-time diagnosis page is refreshed regularly every 10 seconds. You can also disable the timed refresh function.
