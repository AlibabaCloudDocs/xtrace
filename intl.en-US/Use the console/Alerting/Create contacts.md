# Create contacts

When an alert rule is triggered, notifications are sent to the contact group that you specified. Before you create a contact group, you must create contacts. When creating a contact, you can specify the mobile phone number and email address of the contact to receive notifications. You can also provide a DingTalk chatbot webhook URL used to automatically send alert notifications.

To add a DingTalk chatbot as a contact, you must obtain its webhook URL first. For more information, see Enable DingTalk chatbot alert.

## Procedure

1.  Log on to the console. Click the target application in **Applications**. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Alerts** \> **Alert Policies**.

2.  On the Alert Policies page, click **Create Alert** in the upper-right corner.

3.  On the **Contacts** tab, click **Create Contact** in the upper-right corner.

4.  In **Create Contact** dialog box, edit contact information.

    -   To add a contact, enter the **Name**, **Phone Number** and **Email**.

        **Note:** The phone number and email address cannot be blank at the same time. Each phone number or email address must be used for only one contact. You can create a maximum of 100 contacts.

    -   To add a DingTalk chatbot, enter the name and the webhook URL of the chatbot.
