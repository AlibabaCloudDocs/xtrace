# Before you begin

Before using the tracing analysis console, you need to complete the preparations, including activating and authorizing related services and configuring applications.

## Activate related services and authorize roles

Before using tracing analysis, you must activate the tracing analysis service. As tracing analysis depends on LOG service and RAM, you must activate these two services and authorize tracing analysis to read and write your LOG service data.

For more information about how to activate related services and authorize them, see activate [Activate related services and authorize roles](/intl.en-US/Setup/Enable Tracing Analysis service.md) them.

## Application Access

Integrating with applications is to report the trace data of an application to the tracing analysis console from the client. You can report application data in programming languages such as Java, PHP, Go, Python, JS,. NET, and C ++ to the tracing analysis console. Supported clients for data reporting include Jaeger, Zipkin, and Skywalking. Check the application access document based on your application language or client.
